# Python Projects

Here are the python projects I have worked on. The "Level 1" folder contains projects that are basic python skills practice.

Advanced algorithm practice can be found in the "Level 2" folder.  

Projects that have animations can be found in the "Level 3" folder. Animations are done using the pygame and tsk libraries.
