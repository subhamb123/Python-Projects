# Python Projects

Here are the python projects I have worked on. A majority of them are personal projects while few are for school assignments.

The "Level 1" folder contains projects that are basic python skills practice.

Advanced algorithm practice can be found in the "Level 2" folder.  

Projects that have animations can be found in the "Level 3" folder. Animations are done using the pygame and tsk libraries. 

Majority of the projects in the "level 4" folder uses skills from level 3 while practicing functions.
